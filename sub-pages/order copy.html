            <p class="description">When we launched our service in 2018, we decided to offer a unique proposition: We
                only charged our customers after the writing service had been provided and our customers were 100%
                satisfied. The success of that initiative has resulted in its continued practice, making us the only
                resume writing company in the industry that offers a truly 100% risk-free proposition. We only want our
                customers to pay after they’ve worked with their assigned writer and they’re 100% satisfied.
